# Welcome to Slugged!

Slugged is a reddit clone created with **vite** that you can find hosted at

```
www.slugged-portfolio.netlify.com
```

Slugged uses my own personal backend which you can find hosted at

```
https://news-server-project.herokuapp.com/
```

or you can find the repo at

```
https://github.com/emilyb93/Backend-Project-Hosting
```

## Installing

To run this app locally, you can clone with your terminal by navigating to the location you wish, and use the following command;

```
git clone https://github.com/emilyb93/Front-end-project-hosting.git
```

Then the following commands

```
cd slugged

npm install

npm start
```

This will start a local server which you can interact with at

```
https://localhost:3000
```

The site works in a similar way to reddit. You will be permanently signed in to a user by the name of 'jessjelly'.
This will allow you to post comments without issue.

## Navigation

On every page you will have a header bar available with 3 sections.

1. The slugged icon - This will take you back to the homepage at any point.

2. The slug navigation bar. This will display either 'Home' on the home page or the current page you are on. If you click this section with the burger menu, you will be met with a drop down of other available pages on the site, which you can click to navigate to.

3. The profile section. Clicking this will take you to the user page for the currently signed in user.
